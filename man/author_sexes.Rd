\description{
Data frame containing author sexes.
}
\details{
Most author sexes come from matching authors' names against 1940--1995 US
Social Security Administration baby name data provided by the package
\emph{babynames}, and against Facebook name and self-reported gender data
collected by Tang et al. (2011).
Remaining sexes come from manual identification, which involves searching for
gendered pronouns in online biographies, news articles, and professional and
social media profiles.
It also involves using online photos and video (e.g., interview and lecture)
footage.
